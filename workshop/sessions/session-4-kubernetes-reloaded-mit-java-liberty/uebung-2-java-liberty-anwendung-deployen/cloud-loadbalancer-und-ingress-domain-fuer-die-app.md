# optional: Cloud Loadbalancer und Ingress \(Domain\) fÃ¼r die App

In the previous step, the application was accessed with a not standard port. The service was exposed by way of Kubernetes NodePort feature.

Paid clusters come with an IBM-provided domain. This gives you a better option to expose applications with a proper URL and on standard HTTP/S ports.

Use Ingress to set up the cluster inbound connection to the service.

1. Identify your IBM-provided **Ingress domain**

   ```bash
   ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster ${MYCLUSTER}
   ```

   or via your Cluster Overview in the Browser:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2857%29.png)

to find

```yaml
Ingress subdomain: mycluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
Ingress secret:    mycluster
```

1. Create an Ingress file `ingress-ibmdomain.yml` pointing to your domain with support for HTTP and HTTPS. Use the following file as a template, replacing all the values wrapped in &lt;&gt; with the appropriate values from the above output. **service-name** is the name under `==> v1/Service` in the above step. You can also use `kubectl get svc` to find the service name of type **NodePort**.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: ingress-for-ibmdomain-http-and-https
   spec:
     tls:
     - hosts:
       -  <nameofproject>.<ingress-sub-domain>
       secretName: <ingress-secret>
     rules:
     - host: <nameofproject>.<ingress-sub-domain>
       http:
         paths:
         - path: /
           backend:
             serviceName: <service-name>
             servicePort: 9080
   ```

2. Deploy the Ingress

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ingress-ibmdomain.yml
   ```

   Access your application at `https://<nameofproject>.<ingress-sub-domain>/`
